# Wedding WebCard
A responsive Wedding Card or more specifically Wedding e-CARD.
## Project Idea
In India, there is a well established tradition that is prevailing from Centuries to invite friends,relatives,neighbours,etc to ceremonial gatherings, especially to Marriages through the medium of an INVITATION CARD. 
* After the complete Covid-19 Lockdown period, when the things , places started operating as normal with governmental restrictions on wedding guests, the primary problem that was faced by the people is the delivery of the wedding cards to their invitees.
* It was almost impossible to hand over the Wedding Invitation Card physically. So, I decided to make a WEDDING WEBCARD to sort out the problem.
